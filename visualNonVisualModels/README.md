- To run our rule-base model and a simple biased coin baseline, run ```python baseline.py```
- To run our LSTM method, run ```python fitlstm.py``` 

These will run the codes with the models used in the paper. Look for comments inside on how to re-train. Official instructions for training will be added soon
