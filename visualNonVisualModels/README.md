#Visual vs. Non Visual Question identification

### Pre-requisites:

- Spacy: 
  - ```pip install spacy```
  - ```sputnik --name spacy --repository-url http://index.spacy.io install en==1.1.0```

- Keras Deep Learning Library:
  - ```pip install keras```

- Scikit Learn Package
  - ```pip install -U scikit-learn```

### How to run code:

- To run our rule-base model and a simple biased coin baseline, run ```python baseline.py```
- To run our LSTM method, run ```python fitlstm.py``` 

These will run the codes with the models used in the paper. Look for comments inside on how to re-train. Official instructions for training will be added soon
